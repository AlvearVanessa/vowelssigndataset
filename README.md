# Vowels Sign Dataset

In this work we presented three image classification models of the vowels of the Spanish Sign language (Lengua de Signos Espa√±ola - LSE). 
The vowelsLSE dataset consists of 5 gestures of one person signing each vowel according to LSE, and contain 6078 images. It consists of RGB images in JPG format with a size of 300 x 300. This dataset has been created as a proof of concept and is being worked on for improvement in future updates. 

The repository include three notebooks:
    NN1_keras.ipynb. It is a simple neural network created with Keras and Tensorflow library.
    NN2_keras.ipynb. It is a more complex neural network created with Keras and Tensorflow library using Keras Tuner for hyperparameter search.
    ResNet50_fastai.ipynb. It is a model which applied ResNet50 architecture and used the FastAI library. 

The corresponding datasets for the keras and fastai models are in the following link: https://unirioja-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/maalvear_unirioja_es/Er6c7GX0wa9GnSh-8NHbmasBqsu0rWjs6Z__94RpQ4PK8A?e=XikLY9
